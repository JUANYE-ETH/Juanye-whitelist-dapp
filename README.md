A whitelist dApp that let's you add your address to the crypto dev whitelist. 

This dApp is using the mumbai polygon network. 

You must add mumbai matic to your wallet to add your wallet address to the whitelist.

You can do this by heading to https://chainlist.org/chain/80001

It will ask to connect to your wallet. (Make sure you are using a test wallet address you don't care about)

Then you will click "Add-To-Metamask"

Once you have mumbai network added to your metamask you need to use a mumbai polygon faucet to get some test matic.

I use https://mumbaifaucet.com/

Once you have the test matic, you can now use the Whitelist dApp to add your address to the whitelist.
